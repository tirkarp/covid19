# Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker

[Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/) is a not-for-profit organization located at Harvard University that seeks to translate insights from rigorous, scientific research to policy change by harnessing the power of big data using an interdisciplinary approach. It is curating a dataset that answers how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the economic prospects of people, businesses, and communities across the United States.
