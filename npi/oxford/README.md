# Oxford COVID-19 Government Tracker (OxCGRT)

University of Oxford [Blavatnik School of Government](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/covidtracker) has created a tracker that collects systematic information on which governments have taken which measures, and when. This can help decision-makers and citizens understand governmental responses in a consistent way, aiding efforts to fight the pandemic. 

Data is collected by a team of over 100 volunteers from the Oxford community, sourcing publicly available information on 17 indicators of government response including the statistics on the number of reported Covid-19 cases and deaths in each country taken from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)](../../testing/ecdc/) and [John Hopkins CSSE data repository](../../testing/jhu/). It is updated continuously.

## Dataset

OxCGRT systematically collects information on several different common policy responses governments have taken, records these policies on a scale to reflect the extent of government action, and aggregates these scores into a suite of policy indices. It contains information such as:

- containment and closure policies
  - school closing
  - workplace closing
  - restrictions on public events
  - restrictions on public transport
  - lockdowns and stay-at-home policies
- economic policies
  - income support
  - debt relief
  - fiscal measures
  - international support
- health system policies
  - public information campaign
  - testing policy
  - contact tracing policy
  - investment in vaccines
  - emergency investment in healthcare
- and many more...

Data is updated every hour, and is available back till _January 1st, 2020_.
