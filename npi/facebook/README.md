# Facebook NPI & Infrastructure Data

Facebook is providing [tools for researchers](https://dataforgood.fb.com) to use aggregated location data of opt-in Facebook users for disaster prevention purposes. Some resources they provide are publicly available (such as population density maps), while some require registering and signing the [data use agreement](data-sharing-agreement.pdf), upon which you will be sent an invitation to a Slack workspace and the [GeoInsights Portal][1].

Purdue has an existing data agreement with Facebook Data for Good, signed by [Ken Sandel](mailto:sandel@purdue.edu). Please reach out to him to request access to Facebook's mobility data. 

Alternatively, we have downloaded this dataset for our own use, available in the [`dataset/`](dataset/) directory.

## Dataset

The [Inclusive Internet Index](https://theinclusiveinternet.eiu.com/), commissioned by Facebook and conducted by The Economist Intelligence Unit, seeks to measure the extent to which the Internet is not only accessible and affordable, but also relevant to all, allowing usage that enables positive social and economic outcomes at the individual and group level. It contains ranking and information such as:

- Internet availability
- Internet affordability
- existence of local Internet content
- capacity to access Internet

This dataset is updated yearly.

In addition, Facebook provides [numerous datasets](../../mobility/facebook/) on human mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Please visit our [`mobility/facebook/`](../../mobility/facebook/) directory to learn more.

## Accessing Data

You can view and download the Inclusive Internet Index on its own [website](https://theinclusiveinternet.eiu.com/). Alternatively, you can view it in our [`dataset/`](dataset/) directory. Last updated in _2020_.
