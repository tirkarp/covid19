# Jataware COVID-19 Open Data

[Jataware](https://www.jataware.com/) is a engineering company that provides consulting, software and data solutions for commercial and government organizations. It has curated datasets for response efforts by different communities to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

## Datasets

We found two datasets that contain data on:

- [**non-pharmaceutical interventions**](#non-pharmaceutical-interventions) at a city, county and country level
- [**healthcare capacity**](#healthcare-capacity) at a state and country level

**Note**: these datasets are automatically curated and not vetted by humans. They should not be relied on as accurate information.
