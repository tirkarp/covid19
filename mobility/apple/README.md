# [Apple Mobility Trends Reports](https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility)

Apple has [curated a dataset](https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility) that features daily changes in requests for directions by transportation type for all available countries/regions, sub-regions, and cities. 

This data is generated by counting the number of requests made to Apple Maps for directions in select countries/regions, sub-regions, and cities. Data that is sent from users’ devices to the Maps service is associated with random, rotating identifiers so Apple doesn’t have a profile of users' movements and searches. The availability of data in a particular country/region, sub-region, or city is based on a number of factors, including minimum thresholds for direction requests per day.


## Datasets 

[Apple Mobility Trends Reports](https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility) shows the **relative volume of directions requests** per country/region, sub-region or city compared to a baseline volume on January 13th, 2020. 

According to its website: 

> A day is defined as midnight-to-midnight, Pacific time. Cities are defined as the greater metropolitan area and their geographic boundaries remain constant across the data set. In many countries/regions, sub-regions, and cities, relative volume has increased since January 13th, consistent with normal, seasonal usage of Apple Maps. Day of week effects are important to normalize as you use this data. 

Data is updated every day, and is available back till the baseline date on _January 13th, 2020_.

|-|-|-|-|
| `geo_type` | Type of geometric region represented. Possible values are: <ul><li>`country/region`</li><li>`city`</li><li>`sub-region`</li><li>`county`</li></ul> | string | country/region |
| `region` | Name of the `geo_type` in which data was collected | string | Albania |

| `alternative_name` | Alternative name for the region, may be empty | string | Brasil |
| `sub-region` | Name of the first [administrative unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_division#:~:text=For%20clarity%20and%20convenience%20the,or%20%22second%20administrative%20level%22) in which the data was collected, may be empty. Represents a state in the US. | string | New York |
| `country` | Country in which the data was collected, may be empty if `geo_type` is `country/region`. | string | United States |
| `1/13/2020` | Relative volume of direction request on Jan 13th, 2020 compared to baseline on Jan 13th, 2020, in percentage, in this case always 100. | float | 100 |
| `1/14/2020` | Relative volume of direction request on Jan 14th, 2020 compared to baseline on Jan 14th, 2020, in percentage | float | 95.3 |
| `1/15/2020` | Relative volume of direction request on Jan 15th, 2020 compared to baseline on Jan 15th, 2020, in percentage | float | 101.43 |
| ... | ...time series data... | float | ... |
