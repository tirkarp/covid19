# GHCN (Daily Global Historical Climatology Network)-Daily

GHCN-Daily is a database of climate records that stores historical daily temperature, precipitation and snow records over global land areas.

Information in GHCN-Daily is recorded from land-based stations from the [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/), as well as from the [World Meteorological Organization (WMO)](https://public.wmo.int/en). It is known to be the most complete record of the Earth's climate since instrumental measurements began. Some observations dates back as early as the late 1600s. [[1]]

## Datasets

**GHCN-Daily** contains observations of more than 100,000 stations distributed across all continents, presenting over 40 meteorological elements including daily maximum/minimum **temperature** at observation time, **precipitation**, **snowfall**, snow depth, **evaporation**, **wind movement**, wind maximums, **soil temperature**, **cloudiness**, and more. Station records are updated daily where possible and are usually available one to two days after the date and time of the observation. [[1]]

GHCN is only one dataset among the hundreds that the [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access) offers. Please visit the [NOAA website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access) for access to more datasets from [land-based stations](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets), [satellites](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/satellite-data), [radar](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/radar-data), [weather ballons](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/weather-balloon-data), and more.

Alternatively, the [NOAA](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access) also offers a suite of API endpoints to [discover datasets](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/support/access-search-service-api-user-documentation), [download datasets](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/support/access-data-service-api-user-documentation) and [query climatological datasets](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2).
