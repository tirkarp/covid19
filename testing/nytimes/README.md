# New York Times COVID-19 Data

The New York Times is curating a dataset that attempts to accurately reflect the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States and around the world, despite the lack of testing in many places.

Data is compiled from state and local governments and health departments, the product of dozens of journalists working across several time zones to monitor news conferences, analyze data releases and seek clarification from public officials on how they categorize cases. For excess deaths, NYT has consulted with demographers, medical officials and local sources to confirm that this data is broadly representative of how many people have died. In some countries, the number of burials, hospital deaths or other factors are used to confirm that the underlying trends are representative.

## Datasets

The New York Times published 3 main datasets on COVID-19:

- [**Live and historical data**](#live-and-historical-data): current and historical COVID-19 cases in the US, including confirmed cases and deaths
- [**Excess deaths**](#excess-deaths): expected number of COVID-19 deaths worldwide, including those not reported in official figures
- [**Mask usage**](#mask-usage): survey of mask usage in the United States

## Accessing Data

Summary and analysis of cases data is found on the [New York Times website](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).
