# European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) COVID-19 Data

[European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/about-ecdc) is an agency under the European Union aimed at strengthening Europe's defences against infectious diseases. Among ECDC's core functions include surveillance, epidemic intelligence, response, scientific advice, microbiology, preparedness, public health training, international relations, health communication, and the scientific journal Eurosurveillance.

ECDC has collected data [from multiple sources](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data) related to COVID-19, most notable ones being daily cases and testing data. Every day between 6.00 and 10.00 CET, a team of epidemiologists screens up to 500 relevant sources to collect the latest figures. The data screening is followed by ECDCâ€™s standard [epidemic intelligence process](https://external.ecdc.europa.eu/EI_Tutorial/course.htm) for which every single data entry is validated and documented in an ECDC database. Read the [data collection methodology](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data-collection).
