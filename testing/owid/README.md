[Our World in Data (OWID)](https://ourworldindata.org/about) is a project of the [Global Change Data Lab](https://global-change-data-lab.org/), an educational charity based in Oxford, UK. Its mission is to publish research and data to make progress against the worldâ€™s largest problems.

OWID has curated [datasets](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) that answers how COVID-19 pandemic is spreading, what impact the pandemic has, how we can make progress against the pandemic, and whether the measures countries are taking are successful or not.
