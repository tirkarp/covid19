# Writing Considerations

When writing the README, keep in mind the goal of providing high-level, dense, technical information in the quickest and easiet way possible. Understand common user behaviors when reading technical documentation, notably:

- Users will likely **not** read everything top-to-bottom, but will jump here and there, skim through sections to get to the information they want. Information should **jump out** at them. Users shouldn't have to go scrambling to find what they want. It is important, therefore, to use visual cues to grab their attention:
  - Use clear, simple structure, proper headings, subheadings
  - Important information should be **bolded**
  - Unfamiliar terms should be _italicized_
  - Use markdown commands that will give correct semantics
  - No long paragraphs
  - Try to provide as much visuals to reduce concentration effort
    
- Users don't want to open a new tab, or scroll back and forth and study new information they don't understand -- that takes too much effort
  - Provide links to useful resources where appropriate, **without having them find it themselves**
  - Repeat information in multiple places if necessary
  - Consider semantics and accessibility use cases outlined in [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/links-should-never-say-click-here/).

- Users don't want to waste time
  - Every word *counts*. Don't put it there if it serves nothing.
  - Use simple language that makes it effortless to understand the content
  - Leave out unimportant details. We want a high-level overview. Provide links to them instead.
  - Users should be able to understand everything at one quick glance, without re-reading
  
## Style Guide

- Do not jump heading levels. e.g. Top-level heading is `#`, the sub-section from that should use `##`, not `###`
- Use `**bold**` for **bold**
- Use `_italics_` for _italics_
- Use `- list` for lists
- **List heading**: bold it. And don't bold the `:`
- Style links with `[**title**](link)`, not `**[title](link)**`
- Use [reference-style links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#reference-style-links) for repeated links
