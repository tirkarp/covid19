# Surgo Foundation's Precision for COVID Data

[Surgo Foundation](http://surgofoundation.org) is a privately-funded action tank who develops models and frameworks to help unlock some of the world's biggest challenges. It brings together all the tools available from behavioral science, data science, and artificial intelligence to solve problems in areas such as coronavirus, maternal health, tuberculosis, and HIV in the US and around the globe.

Surgo Foundation has put together datasets called [Precision for COVID](https://precisionforcovid.org/) to explore questions like understanding who is most vulnerable and why, where the disease is spreading the fastest, and how interventions like social distancing are working. Among these datasets, the _COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI)_ provides insights as to where resources are needed the most in different vulnerable communities.  

From Precision for COVID's [website](https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi):

> The CCVI builds on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), a validated metric to help policymakers and public health officials respond to disasters, including disease outbreaks. The current COVID-19 outbreak poses new challenges contingent on a host of health and structural factors, not all of which are captured in the SVI.
> 
> To understand vulnerability within the context of the coronavirus pandemic, the CCVI incorporates the SVI’s sociodemographic variables, which fall into four themes, along with risk factors specific to COVID-19 and variables measuring the capacity of public health systems. This results in six core themes that together account for 34 factors that make a community vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Dataset

Surgo Foundation has developed a series of datasets containing the [community vulnerability index](https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi), the [confirmed cases](https://precisionforcovid.org/cases), [social distancing index](https://precisionforcovid.org/distancing), [nurses' sentiment](https://precisionforcovid.org/providers), [social distancing poll data](https://precisionforcovid.org/distancing-poll), among others.

From these, only the [_COVID-19 Community Vulnerability Index (CCVI)_](https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi) contains the source data on community vulnerability.

There is no known information as to how often data is updated, but you can read the brief methodology on the [website](https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi), or read its [detailed methodology document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/142EPwY0GqcSJlsD2fJOHIg_2G4e2ksxy8iToJ7maP4Y).

## Accessing Data

You can view a visualization of the CCVI at its [website](https://precisionforcovid.org/ccvi). Surgo Foundation has also made available a visualization of the [CCVI + cases data](https://precisionforcovid.org/cases).

You can access the actual dataset via [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qEPuziEpxj-VG11IAZoa5RWEr4GhNoxMn7aBdU76O5k). We have downloaded a local copy for easier viewing, available in the [`dataset/`](dataset/) directory. Last updated _August 6th, 2020_.
