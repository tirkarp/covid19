# Nexoid Vulnerability Data

[Nexoid](https://www.nexoid.com/) is a software company that provide services in terms of research, analysis, and computer science. 
They are currently working on creating and sharing datasets on COVID-19.

Data is being gathered by using their [COVID-19 risk calculator](https://www.covid19survivalcalculator.com/en/calculator)
a calculator which asks about the person's body trait, relavent health factors, and environmental factors, and outputs the relative risk the person is facing.

More information on how they calculate the risk a person is facing can be found [here](https://www.covid19survivalcalculator.com/en/research)

## Datasets
Nexoid has one master dataset and a few more files/data derived from it.

[Master Dataset](#master-dataset): the entire dataset gathered from the [COVID-19 risk calculator](https://www.covid19survivalcalculator.com/en/calculator) including geographical, behavior, 
segmentation, health, conditions, medications, and risk values. 

The files derived are:
- Heat maps
- [Prescription drug correlation with risk of infection](#correlation-with-risk-of-infection)
- [Behavior correlation with risk of infection](#correlation-with-risk-of-infection)

## How to access Data 
You can access all the data mentioned above by visting the [Nexoid's COVID-19 risk calculator download page](https://www.covid19survivalcalculator.com/download)

## Master Dataset
The master dataset contains information from people filling out the [COVID-19 risk calculator](https://www.covid19survivalcalculator.com/en/calculator).
