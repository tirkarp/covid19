# Vulnerability

This directory contains datasets related to population vulnerability to COVID-19. 

Vulnerability herein is defined as the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of a given community to respond to the effects of COVID-19. Vulnerability data quantify the degree of risk a population faces, and help decision makers prioritize resources for different communities. 

Certain factors are usually reported as vulnerability data, including the impact of COVID-19 on different types of demographics, health status, and socio-economic status.

Read [CDC's definition for health vulnerability](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showPcMain.action), and the [dimensions of vulnerability for COVID-19](https://c19hcc.org/resource/vulnerable-population).
