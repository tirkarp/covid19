# The COVID Tracking Project Vulnerability Data

[The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) is a volunteer organization dedicated to collecting and publishing data required to understand the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. 

They collect data daily through volunteers who compile the the latest numbers on tests, cases, hospitalizations, and patient outcomes throughout the different states in the U.S. 

More recently The COVID Tracking Project partnered with the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research and have been collecting racial data on COVID-19 testing and patient outcomes from all 50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia as well.
