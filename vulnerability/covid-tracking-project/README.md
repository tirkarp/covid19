# The COVID Tracking Project Racial Tracker

[The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/race) is a volunteer organization launched from The Atlantic dedicated to collecting and publishing the data required to understand the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.

Every day, the Tracking Project volunteers collect data on COVID-19 testing and patient outcomes from all 50 states, 5 territories, and the District of Columbia. The dataset is currently in use by national and local news organizations across the United States and by research projects and agencies worldwide. Its data API receives about two million requests per day. Read the [methodology](https://covidtracking.com/about-data/sources).

More recently, The COVID Tracking Project has also been collecting race and ethnicity data in association with known cases to better understand vulnerability in the United States. 


## Dataset 

Apart from the [daily tracker](https://covidtracking.com/race), The COVID Tracking Project offers a [dashboard](https://covidtracking.com/race/dashboard) for a analysis and summary on racial dataset. 

The dataset features the number of known positive cases, negative cases, and deaths associated with each race and ethnicity, including white, black, Asian, Latinx, multiracial, etc.

Data is updated every day, and is available back till _April 12th, 2020_.
