# Chmura COVID-19 Economic Vulnerability Index

[Chmura](http://www.chmuraecon.com/) is a company that curates and analyzes labor market data. It is known for providing economic analysis that gives instant, comprehensive and actionable information tailored to their clients' need.

Chmura has created a dataset representing the [_economic vulnerability index_](http://www.chmuraecon.com/interactive/covid-19-economic-vulnerability-index/) — the degree to which a given population experiences job losses as compared to the average job losses expected in the United States. It is based on a model of potential job losses due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, with projections based upon job postings data, industry employment data in 2019Q4, news reports, expert testimony and primary research.

## Dataset

The [_economic vulnerability index_](http://www.chmuraecon.com/interactive/covid-19-economic-vulnerability-index/) is a measurement of the negative impact that the coronavirus crisis can have on employment based upon a region’s mix of industries. For example, accommodation and food services are projected to lose more jobs as a result of the coronavirus (over half of jobs lost, on average) compared to utilities and education services (with mild or no job contractions).

The average vulnerability index score is 100, representing the average job loss expected in the United States. Higher scores indicate the degree to which job losses may be greater — an index of 200, for example, means the rate of job loss can be twice as large as the national average. Conversely, an index of 50 would mean a possible job loss of half the national average. Read the [methodology](http://www.chmuraecon.com/interactive/covid-19-economic-vulnerability-index/).

Data is updated rarely, changing as conditions warrant. Last updated on _April 15,2020_.
