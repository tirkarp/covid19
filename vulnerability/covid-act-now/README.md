# Covid Act Now Risk Model

[Covid Act Now](https://covidactnow.org/) is a non-profit organization of technologists, epidemiologists, and medical professionals working to model how COVID-19 will spread in each U.S. state and county. It publishes and continually updates risk levels in every county based on its [SEIR model](https://covidactnow.org/about#faq).

Data for the model is sourced from [a number of source](https://blog.covidactnow.org/where-does-our-data-come-from/), including the New York Times, COVID Tracking Project, Corona Data Scraper, and the U.S. Census Bureau. For specific data sources and known limitations of each source, please take a look at the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XmKCBWYZr9VQKFAdWh_D7pkpGGM_oR9cPjj-UrNdMJQ/edit#slide=id.g875b45be96_0_301) prepared by the Covid Act Now team.

## Dataset

Covid Act Now model shows the **risk levels** and **3-month case projections** at a county- and state-level based on an [SEIR model](https://covidactnow.org/about#faq) developed with these 5 key indicators:

- **Daily new cases**: how many new cases are confirmed daily?
- **Infection rate**: is the number of infections going down?
- **Test positivity**: is COVID testing widespread enough to identify new cases?
- **ICU headroom**: do hospitals have capacity to treat a surge of COVID hospitalizations?
- **Contacts traced**: are we finding and isolating most new cases before COVID spreads?

Data is updated daily, and is available back till _March 3rd, 2020_.

## Accessing Data

Covid Act Now is available as a visualization on covidactnow.org, and as an [API].

`csv` and `json` files can be downloaded through the [API]. For easier access, we have downloaded the state-level data in the `dataset/` directory. County-level data are not added in the repository due to GitHub size limitations. Last updated _August 11th, 2020_.

The [SEIR model](https://covidactnow.org/resources#seir-epidemiology-model) and the [COVID response simulator](https://covidactnow.org/resources#covid-response-simulator) based on that model is available on Covid Act Now 's [Resource page](https://covidactnow.org/resources#covid-response-simulator).

## Structure

Please see the [official documentation](https://blog.covidactnow.org/covid-act-now-api-intervention-model/)

Data pulled from the [API] are historical data + 3-month case projections should the following interventions occur:

| API Parameter | Intervention Type | R Assumptions |
|-|-|-|
| `NO_INTERVENTION` | None | `3.7` |
| `WEAK_INTERVENTION` | Social distancing | `1.7` |
| `STRONG_INTERVENTION` | Shelter in place | <ul><li>`1.1` for 4 weeks</li><li>`1.0` for 4 weeks</li><li>`0.8` for 4 weeks</li></ul> |
| `OBSERVED_INTERVENTION` | - | A dynamic forecast based on the observed data in a given U.S. state |
