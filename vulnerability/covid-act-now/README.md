# Covid Act Now Risk Model

[Covid Act Now](https://covidactnow.org/) is a non-profit organization of technologists, epidemiologists, and medical professionals working to model how COVID-19 will spread in each U.S. state and county. It publishes and continually updates risk levels in every county based on its [SEIR model](https://covidactnow.org/about#faq).

Data for the model is sourced from [a number of source](https://blog.covidactnow.org/where-does-our-data-come-from/), including the New York Times, COVID Tracking Project, Corona Data Scraper, and the U.S. Census Bureau. For specific data sources and known limitations of each source, please take a look at the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XmKCBWYZr9VQKFAdWh_D7pkpGGM_oR9cPjj-UrNdMJQ/edit#slide=id.g875b45be96_0_301) prepared by the Covid Act Now team.

## Dataset

Covid Act Now model shows the **risk levels** at a county- and state-level based on an [SEIR model](https://covidactnow.org/about#faq) developed with these 5 key indicators:

- **Daily new cases**: how many new cases are confirmed daily?
- **Infection rate**: is the number of infections going down?
- **Test positivity**: is COVID testing widespread enough to identify new cases?
- **ICU headroom**: do hospitals have capacity to treat a surge of COVID hospitalizations?
- **Contacts traced**: are we finding and isolating most new cases before COVID spreads?

Data is updated daily, and is available back till _March 3rd, 2020_.
