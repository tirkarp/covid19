# U.S. Census Experimental Data Products on COVID-19

[U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/) has published a series of surveys under the [experimental data products](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products.html) to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on households, small businesses and overall communities.

Most of the data is directly obtained from separate surveys from the Census Bureau itself, and external survey providers such as the [National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm) or the Census Bureau's in-house [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs).

## Datasets

We found three data products from the bureau that are related to COVID-19 vulnerabilities:

- [**Community Resilience Estimates**](#community-resilience-estimates): index of the ability of community to recover from pandemic based on risk factors
- [**Household Pulse Survey**](#household-pulse-survey): trends on healthcare access, insurance coverage, and mental health through a survey
- [**Small Business Pulse Survey**](#small-business-pulse-survey): effects of changing conditions on small business during the pandemic

More experimental data products can be found on the U.S. Census Bureau's [website](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products.html).

## Accessing Data

All datasets, visualizations and analytics can be viewed downloaded from U.S. Census Bureau's [website](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products.html).

Alternatively, we have downloaded the [Community Resilience Estimates](#community-resilience-estimates) and the [Household Pulse Survey](#household-pulse-survey) in the [`dataset/`](dataset/) directory for easier access. Last updated _August 11th, 2020_.
