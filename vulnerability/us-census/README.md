# U.S. Census Experimental Data Products on COVID-19

[U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/) has published a series of surveys under the [experimental data products](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products.html) to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on households, small businesses and overall communities.

Most of the data is directly obtained from separate surveys from the Census Bureau itself, and external survey providers such as the [National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm) or the Census Bureau's in-house [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs).

## Datasets

We found three data products from the bureau that are related to COVID-19 vulnerabilities:

- [**Community Resilience Estimates**](#community-resilience-estimates): index of the ability of community to recover from pandemic based on risk factors
- [**Household Pulse Survey**](#household-pulse-survey): trends on healthcare access, insurance coverage, and mental health through a survey
- [**Small Business Pulse Survey**](#small-business-pulse-survey): effects of changing conditions on small business during the pandemic

More experimental data products can be found on the U.S. Census Bureau's [website](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products.html).

## Accessing Data

All datasets, visualizations and analytics can be viewed downloaded from U.S. Census Bureau's [website](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products.html).

Alternatively, we have downloaded the [Community Resilience Estimates](#community-resilience-estimates) and the [Household Pulse Survey](#household-pulse-survey) in the [`dataset/`](dataset/) directory for easier access. Last updated _August 11th, 2020_.

## [Community Resilience Estimates](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/community-resilience-estimates.html)

[Community Resilience Estimates](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/community-resilience-estimates.html) measure the ability of a population to recover from the impacts of disasters. This dataset collects the **number of people with certain risk factors** as defined by the [American Cummunity Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) living in each county, state, and census tract.

The specific risk factors used in this datasets are:

#### [ACS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)-defined Risk Factors (RF) for Households (HH) and Individuals (I)

- **RF 1**: Income-to-Poverty Ratio (IPR) < 130 (HH).
- **RF 2**: Single or zero caregiver household –only one or no individuals living in the household who are 18-64 (HH).
- **RF 3a**: Unit-level crowding - persons per room over 0.75 (HH)
- **RF 4**: Communications barrier –linguistically isolated or no one in the household with a high school diploma (HH)
- **RF 5**: No employed persons (HH)
- **RF 7**: Disability posing constraint to significant life activity (I)
- **RF 8**: No health insurance coverage (I)

#### Domain defined RF

- **RF 6**: Age >= 65 (I)
- **RF 3**: RF 3a = 1 or more persons reside within high-density tract (HH)

#### Health Condition RF

- **RF 9**: Serious heart condition (I)
- **RF 10**: Diabetes (I)
- **RF 11**: Emphysema or current asthma (I)

## [Household Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/householdpulsedata)

[Household Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/householdpulsedata) is an experimental data system developed in conjunction with the CDC to monitor trends in mental health, health insurance coverage, and problems accessing care. It consists of a 20-minute [online survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html) designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about the scope of the impact of COVID-19 in the United States.

**Note**: This is the same dataset as described in the [CDC](../cdc/) source.

For dashboards, technical notes, methodology and sample sizes, visit the page on [mental health](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health.htm), [health insurance coverage](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/health-insurance-coverage.htm), and [reduced access to care](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/reduced-access-to-care.htm). Also visit the CDC's [documentation](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/health-care-access-and-mental-health.htm).

Data is updated in nearly real time as soon as the Census Bureau processes the survey responses. It is available back till _April 23rd, 2020_.

- [**`insurance-indicator.csv`**](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Indicators-of-Health-Insurance-Coverage-at-the-Tim/jb9g-gnvr): reported health insurance status within a population, categorized by age, race, gender, state
