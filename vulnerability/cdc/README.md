# Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Vulnerability Data

CDC centralizes reporting data from nearly every state and related government agencies to form official figures for deaths, vulnerability, and disparities. 

Data is usually managed by the [National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm), collected through surveys, hospital surveillance, official county-level and state-level figures, U.S. Census Bureau, and third-party organizations. NCHS is providing the most recent data available on deaths, mental health, and access to health care, loss of work due to illness, and telemedicine.

## Datasets

Among CDC's various datasets, several of them can be used to explore vulnerability:

- [**Weekly Updates**](#weekly-updates): official weekly death counts categorized according to age, sex, race, and medical conditions
- [**Household Pulse Survey**](#household-pulse-survey): trends on healthcare access and mental health through a survey
- [**COVID-NET**](#covid-net): hospital surveillance data that helps calculate hospitalization rates for COVID-19
- [**500 Cities**](#500-cities): city- and census tract-level small area estimates for chronic disease risk factors, health outcomes, and clinical preventive service use for the largest 500 cities in the United States

Data is usually updated weekly. COVID-19 related datasets are usually available back till _February 1st, 2020_.
