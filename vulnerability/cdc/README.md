# Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Vulnerability Data

CDC centralizes reporting data from nearly every state and related government agencies to form official figures for deaths, vulnerability, and disparities. 

Data is usually aggregated through multiple official data sources, collected through surveys, hospital surveillance, official county-level and state-level figures, U.S. Census Bureau, and third-party organizations. NCHS is providing the most recent data available on deaths, mental health, and access to health care, loss of work due to illness, and telemedicine.

## Datasets

Among CDC's various datasets, several of them can be used to explore vulnerability:

- [**COVID-19 Cases, Data and Surveillance**](#covid-19-cases-data-and-surveillance): surveillance data on cases, hospitalization rates, serology, demographics and more
- [**NCHS Weekly Updates**](#nchs-weekly-updates): official weekly death counts categorized according to age, sex, race, and medical conditions
- [**Household Pulse Survey**](#household-pulse-survey): trends on healthcare access and mental health through a survey
- [**500 Cities**](#500-cities): city- and census tract-level small area estimates for chronic disease risk factors, health outcomes, and clinical preventive service use for the largest 500 cities in the United States

Data is usually updated weekly. COVID-19 related datasets are usually available back till _February 1st, 2020_.

More datasets from the CDC can be found on the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/index.html) and [NCHS website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/index.htm). Note that death count from other factors unrelated to COVID-19, both during and before the pandemic is also available.

## Accessing Data

All the datasets are downloaded into the [`dataset/`](dataset/) directory for easier access. Last updated _August 5th, 2020_.

Visualization, analysis and more recent datasets are available on the [CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/index.htm) and [NCHS website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/index.htm)

## [COVID-19 Cases, Data and Surveillance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/index.html)

CDC uses diverse data streams to track and analyze COVID-19 at the local, state, and national levels. It publishes  [COVIDView](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html), CDC's weekly surveillance summary of US COVID-19 activity. Past the summary level, CDC also publishes data on: 

- [**cases**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html): daily cases counts
- [**deaths**](#nchs-weekly-updates): detailed daily and weekly death counts
- [**testing**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html): daily test counts
- [**hospital capacity**](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-capacity): hospital utilization reported to [HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/)
- [**hospital surveillance**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covid-net/purpose-methods.html): COVID-NET hospitalization rates, patient characteristics
- [**serology (antibody) surveillance**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/serology.html): percentage of population who have antibodies against COVID-19
- [**mathematical modeling**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/mathematical-modeling.html): forecasted cases, deaths and hospitalization
- [**pregnancy, race and ethnicity**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/special-populations/index.html): reported cases associated with pregnancy, race and ethnicity

In addition, CDC also publishes a monthly [COVID-19 case surveillance data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf) for public use. Because of size restrictions (~300MB), please access this dataset from the official [CDC website](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf).

### Structure

CDC case surveillance dataset include information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, clinical data, laboratory diagnostic test results, and comorbidities. All data elements are directly recorded from the [COVID-19 case report form](www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf).

Please see [CDC's official documentation](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf) for field descriptions.

## [NCHS Weekly Updates](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm)

[NCHS Weekly Updates](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm) provides a [provisional death count](https://faq.coronavirus.gov/why-are-the-death-counts-different-from-provisional-counts/) for COVID-19, categorized according to select demographic and geographic characteristics. This is a subset of the aforementioned cases data in CDC's datasets. It contains information associated with:

- age and sex
- race and Hispanic origin by jurisdiction and by age
- place of death
- comorbidities
- excess deaths
- state and county data files

Data is released weekly, and is available back till _February 1st, 2020_. 

### Structure

There are a number of datasets available as part of Weekly Updates. We have narrowed down five that are related to vulnerability:

## [Household Pulse Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/health-care-access-and-mental-health.htm)

[Household Pulse Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/health-care-access-and-mental-health.htm) is an experimental data system developed in conjunction with the U.S. Census Bureau to monitor trends in mental health, health insurance coverage, and problems accessing care. It consists of a 20-minute [online survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html) designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about the scope of the impact of COVID-19 in the United States.

## 500 Cities

500 Cities Project provides city- and census tract-level small area estimates for **chronic disease risk factors, health outcomes, and clinical preventive service use** for the largest 500 cities in the United States. These small area estimates will allow cities and local health departments to better understand the burden and geographic distribution of health-related variables in their jurisdictions, and assist them in planning public health interventions.

Data is updated yearly, and is available back till _2018_.

### Structure

[Multiple datasets](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/browse?category=500+Cities) are available for the 500 Cities Project. Please visit the 500 Cities Project [website](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/browse?category=500+Cities) to see the structure and methodology for each dataset.
