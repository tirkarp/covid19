Please use the template below to write a high-level description of data sources. You don't need to follow it exactly, but it should act as a guide on how you can describe a data source.

# Name of source (_e.g. SafeGraph Moblity Data_)

Beginning paragraphs should be short and succinct.

#### First paragraph

Describe the source. What does the source do? 

_e.g. StreetLight Data is a company that does lorem ipsum._

If the source is well known, describe what the source has done or why it is provided. 

_e.g. Apple has curated a dataset that features daily changes blah blah blah._

#### Second paragraph

How is data obtained? 

_e.g. Data is sourced from 1,000 different sources which include..._

#### Third paragraph, if applicable

State who the datasets are intended to be used by, and what it should be used for. If the user has to sign up to use it, provide a link to the sign up page and write what happens after the user signs up. If there is a data use agreement, provide a link. 

_e.g. SafeGraph is providing free access to COVID-19 datasets for researchers through the [COVID-19 Data Consortium](https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium). **You will need to [sign up](https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium) with your Purdue email** and sign the [Data Use Agreement](data-use-agreement.pdf) before being granted access to a Slack workspace, where you will find further instructions and resources._

#### Fourth paragraph, if applicable

Where is the data stored? How can you find it? 

_e.g. Alternatively, we have downloaded the relevant datasets for our own use, available on [Box](https://app.box.com/s/s4wafbxi3hfv3vdwc1pj05kuiuy5p93u)._

## Datasets

List what datasets are available from the source. Provide a high-level overview of what information each dataset contains, and size of each dataset. Define any terminology or information which could be useful at a glance.

If there is only one dataset, also list down how often it is updated and the time period in which the dataset is recorded. 

If only a select dataset is pulled from other available datasets, provide a link to those datasets as well.

_e.g. Among SafeGraph's various datasets, we found three that provide data related to human mobility:

- [**Weekly Patterns**](#weekly-patterns): a dataset of visitor and demographic aggregations available for ~4.1MM POI (~355GB)
- [**Social Distancing Metrics**](#social-distancing-metrics): a summary of population movement aggregated by home census block groups (~243GB)
- [**Core Places**](#core-places): a dataset of information about each POI available in the US (~2GB)

More datasets from SafeGraph can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UNWvPzkUTTlXBZ6M6iGhM_7sr8h-MxsZdE7iOszkAmk/edit#gid=0)._
