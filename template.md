Please use the template below to write a high-level description of data sources. You don't need to follow it exactly, but it should act as a guide on how you can describe a data source.

# Name of source (_e.g. SafeGraph Moblity Data_)

Beginning paragraphs should be short and succinct.

##### First paragraph

Describe the source. What does the source do?

> [SafeGraph](https://safegraph.com) is a company that curates geospatial data. It has built the most comprehensive (commercially available) database in the US for **Places (POI)** where people spend money (~5M POI). 

If the source is well known, describe what the source has done or why it is provided. 

> Apple has [curated a dataset](https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility) that features daily changes in requests for directions by transportation type for all available countries/regions, sub-regions, and cities. 


##### Second paragraph

How is data obtained? 

> Data is generated by counting the number of requests made to Apple Maps for directions in select countries/regions, sub-regions, and cities. Data that is sent from users’ devices to the Maps service is associated with random, rotating identifiers so Apple doesn’t have a profile of users' movements and searches. The availability of data in a particular country/region, sub-region, or city is based on a number of factors, including minimum thresholds for direction requests per day.

##### Third paragraph, if applicable

State who the datasets are intended to be used by, and what it should be used for. If the user has to sign up to use it, provide a link to the sign up page and write what happens after the user signs up. If there is a data use agreement, provide a link. 

> SafeGraph is providing free access to COVID-19 datasets for researchers through the [COVID-19 Data Consortium](https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium). **You will need to [sign up](https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium) with your Purdue email** and sign the [Data Use Agreement](data-use-agreement.pdf) before being granted access to a Slack workspace, where you will find further instructions and resources.

##### Fourth paragraph, if applicable

Where is the data stored? How can you find it? 

> Alternatively, we have downloaded the relevant datasets for our own use, available on [Box](https://app.box.com/s/s4wafbxi3hfv3vdwc1pj05kuiuy5p93u).

## Dataset(s)

List what datasets are available from the source. Provide a high-level overview of what information each dataset contains, and size of each dataset. Define any terminology or information which could be useful at a glance. Provide link to methodologies on how data was obtained, or more info on wha the data means.

> Among SafeGraph's various datasets, we found three that provide data related to human mobility:
> 
> - [**Weekly Patterns**](#weekly-patterns): a dataset of visitor and demographic aggregations available for ~4.1MM POI (~355GB)
> - [**Social Distancing Metrics**](#social-distancing-metrics): a summary of population movement aggregated by home census block groups (~243GB)
> - [**Core Places**](#core-places): a dataset of information about each POI available in the US (~2GB)

If there is only one dataset, also list down how often it is updated and the time period during which the dataset is recorded. 

> Data is updated every day, and is available back till the baseline date on _January 13th, 2020_.

If only a select dataset is pulled from other available datasets, provide a link to those datasets as well.

> More datasets from SafeGraph can be found in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UNWvPzkUTTlXBZ6M6iGhM_7sr8h-MxsZdE7iOszkAmk/edit#gid=0).

## Accessing Data

Describe how you can access the data. If you need to sign up, provide the link. 

List down all possible ways by which you can retrieve data in any format. Provide step-by-step, detailed instructions. If there is a recommend method for retrieving data, be sure to note that. 

> You can view a visualization of the changes in US mobility on [Descartes Labs' website](https://www.descarteslabs.com/mobility/). Or, download the dataset through Descartes Labs' [GitHub repo](https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19), or throuh our [`dataset/`](dataset/) directory.
> 
> A [script](https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19/tree/master/scripts) is available to plot mobility index.

Visit this repo's SafeGraph [data access instructions](mobility/safegraph/README.md#how-to-access) for an example.

## Name of dataset (_e.g. Weekly Patterns_)

Provide more detailed description about the dataset than what is written in the [Dataset(s)](#datasets) section.

List how often the dataset is updated, when it is last updated, when it was first updated. 

> Patterns is a dataset of visitor and demographic aggregations available for ~4.1MM POI that answer how often people visit, where they came from, where else they go, and more. It contains information _such as (non-exhaustive)_:
> 
> - visitor count to a POI (per hour or day)
> - distance from home travelled by visitors
> - duration of the visits 
> - other brands that visitors to a particular POI also visit
> 
> Data is released weekly, and is available back till _January 1st, 2019_. 

You should also provide links that users can access to read more about the dataset, the methodology, the motivation. 

> Read the [blog post](https://medium.com/descarteslabs-team/covid-19-the-road-to-economic-and-social-recovery-6638866e3e4c) to understand more about the dataset, or read [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.14228.pdf) that describes the motivation behind the methodology.

Repeat this section for all the datasets, and include the following subsection below each one:

### Structure

Describe how the dataset is structured. What are the files? What do the files contain? What's the directory structure?

If the structure is too long to list, you may provide a link to a documentation that describe this in more details.

> Please see SafeGraph's [documentation](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns).
> 
> The dataset is organized into 4 directories:
> 
> - [**main-file**](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns#section-schema): each file contains patterns data for each week 
> - [**home-summary-file**](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns#section-home-location-distributions-by-state-census-block-group): breakdown of the home origin of the devices in each _weekly patterns_
> - [**normalization-stats**](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns#section-normalization-stats): information such as _total visits_ or _total devices seen_ each week for normalization
> - [**release-metadata**](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs/weekly-patterns#section-release-metadata): metadata about each week, such as _total POI_


> Please read Descartes Labs' [documentation](https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19/blob/master/README.md).
> 
> This dataset is available in `csv` and [`ndjson`](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec) formats. It is organized as 5 different files:
> 
> - [**`DL-us-mobility.ndjson`**](https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19/blob/master/DL-us-mobility.ndjson): all mobility data in [NDJSON](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec) format.
> - [**`DL-us-mobility-daterow.csv`**](https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19/blob/master/DL-us-mobility-daterow.csv): all mobility data in CSV format
> - [**`DL-us-m50.csv`**](https://github.com/descarteslabs/DL-COVID-19/blob/master/DL-us-m50.csv): same data as `DL-us-mobility-daterow.csv`, but only with the `m50` field in time series format

Provide links to terminologies users may find unfamiliar. 

If the dataset is in `json` format, or will need to be requested via an API, you may provide a sample code block to illustrate the structure.

> ```json
> {"cc": "US", "admin_level": 2, 
> "admin1": "New Mexico", "admin2": "Santa Fe County", "fips": "35049", 
> "date": ["2020-03-24", "2020-03-25", "2020-03-26"],

Write down notes that may be of interest, or useful to the user.

> **Notes**: data for May 11-12 is not available and will appear as blank columns in the data set. Fields may be empty.

> **Note**: all `safegraph_place_id`s and `safegraph_brand_id`s in _Weekly Patterns_ data should be found in SafeGraph's [_Core Places_](https://docs.safegraph.com/docs#section-core-places) dataset, should you need any cross-referencing or more details about each place.
